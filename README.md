### Using the bot

Coding For All is a messenger bot that can send you Computer Science resources catered to your interests and experience level.
To chat with the bot, go to its [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/codingforeveryone/), click the `Send message` button, and say hi!

### Logging
If you want logs from `debug`,
you have to have the `DEBUG` environment variable set appropriately;
I like to use `DEBUG=*` to just get everything (including from Express!)
but you can also set e.g. `DEBUG=codingforall::*` to only get our own.
